This directory contains the main file for detecting neologisms. Several files are provided, one per language (detect_neologisms_<lang>.py, and one is for all languages (detect_neologisms_all.py).
The .sh file is an example to launcg the programs as a scheduled task (cron job).

Some comments inside the .py files enable to understand the processes implied. Do not forget to change the global parameters (at the beginning of each file) for:

* Treetagger or other POS tagger
* Hunspell dictionaries
* Apache Solr web adress
* Mysql parameters.


The [tobeindexed] subdirectory is used to generate xml files for Apache Solr import.
The [log] subdirectory is used for log files generated by detect_neologisms_<lang>.py files.
